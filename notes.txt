There's a quiet calming element to bonsai.

That solitary connection between you and the tree that stills the mind

No matter the daily stresses there's nothing in the world that really brings
life into focus quite like interacting with a tree one on one.

And that since the focus is only heightened by the knowledge of the fragility of our chosen
medium and creating living art.

I think it's a common misconception that bonsai is about control or manipulation
or that our main concern is with the outcome of design.

Quite to the contrary a bonsai is no longer a bonsai if it's
dead and perhaps just as importantly if it's not thriving.

Failure to recognize that a plant is a living entity and that
that life can be snuffed out in an instant whether it be through improper
care or misapplication of technique is ultimately failure to practice bonsai at the most fundamental level.

Rather than trying to fit in the box thinking against an out-of-the-box
mentality I prefer to approach bonsai if there is no box to begin with

In other words Bonsai is an art that transcends culture transcends the need
for labels and ultimately brings people together through a very human desire to
be closer to nature

It's an incremental art form as well, not only in that the
trees are forever changing as branches naturally grow or perish but also in the
sense that many hands over decades might influence the design of an individual
tree as its passed on from person to person

That interconnectivity between nature and humanity is what sets bonsai
apart as an art form

Undertaking the six year apprenticeship
in Japan and subsequently working as a
professional in the Japanese bonsai
community has not only opened my mind to
what bonsai can become through intense
pursuit of the art at the highest level
but it's awakened in me a desire to
spread that passion and love for bonsai
around the world to inspire and spark
creativity in generations both old and
young and to infuse a bit of happiness
into folks lives through nature and
across cultures

And that's what I intend to do
