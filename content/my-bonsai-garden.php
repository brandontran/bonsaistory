    My garden is my zen place that I tune into nature and find grounding. I enjoy the sunshine, rain and cold outside. Each time I step outside I have something that needs tending to and that needs nurturing. It's true that we don't ever truly own land, we are just stewards of the land. And I enjoy protecting and improving it.
