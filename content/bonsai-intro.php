  <h3>Bonsai Care and Techniques</h3>

  <p><strong>Watering</strong> - The ideal amount of watering is necessary to keep your tree in good health. Trees need water daily but ensure good fast draining soils for best health.</p>
  <p><strong>Training</strong> - The use of wires to train branches with a desired style.</p>
